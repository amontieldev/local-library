#### getBooksPossessedByAccount()

The `getBooksPossessedByAccount` function in `public/src/accounts.js` has three parameters, in the following order:

- An account object.
- An array of all book objects.
- An array of all author objects.

It returns an array of book objects, including author information, that represents all books _currently checked out_ by the given account. _Look carefully at the object below,_ as it's not just the book object; the author object is nested inside of it.

**Example:**

```javascript
getBooksPossessedByAccount(account, books, authors);
/*
  [
    {
      id: "5f447132320b4bc16f950076",
      title: "est voluptate nisi",
      genre: "Classics",
      authorId: 12,
      author: {
        id: 12,
        name: {
          first: "Chrystal",
          last: "Lester",
        },
      },
      borrows: [
        {
          id: "5f446f2e6059326d9feb9a68",
          returned: false,
        },
        ...
      ],
    },
  ]
*/
```

### Book functions



#### partitionBooksByBorrowedStatus()

The `partitionBooksByBorrowedStatus()` function in `public/src/books.js` has a single parameter:

- An array of book objects.

It returns an array with two arrays inside of it. All of the inputted books are present in either the first or second array.

The first array contains book objects that represent the books _that are currently checked out_, while the second array contains book objects that represent the books _that have been returned._ You can check for the return status by looking at the first transaction object in the `borrows` array.

**Example:**



#### getBorrowersForBook()

The `getBorrowersForBook()` function in `public/src/books.js` has two parameters, in the following order:

- A book object.
- An array of all account objects.

It should return an array of ten or fewer account objects that represents the accounts given by the IDs in the provided book's `borrows` array. However, each account object should include the `returned` entry from the corresponding transaction object in the `borrows` array.

**Example:**

```javascript
getBorrowersForBook(book, accounts);
/*
  [
    {
      id: "5f446f2e4eff1030e7316861",
      returned: true,
      picture: "https://api.adorable.io/avatars/75/barber.waters@kegular.biz",
      age: 37,
      name: {
        first: "Barber",
        last: "Waters",
      },
      company: "KEGULAR",
      email: "barber.waters@kegular.biz",
      registered: "Tuesday, April 14, 2020 9:15 PM",
    },
    {
      id: "5f446f2ecc5c4787c403f844",
      returned: true,
      picture: "https://api.adorable.io/avatars/75/dyer.trevino@slax.io",
      age: 34,
      name: {
        first: "Dyer",
        last: "Trevino",
      },
      company: "SLAX",
      email: "dyer.trevino@slax.io",

### getMostCommonGenres()

The `getMostCommonGenres()` function in `public/src/home.js` has a single parameter:

- An array of book objects.

It returns an array containing five objects or fewer that represents the most common occurring genres, ordered from most common to least.

Each object in the returned array has two keys:

- The `name` key which represents the name of the genre.
- The `count` key which represents the number of times the genre occurs.

Even if there is a tie, the array should only contain no more than five objects.

**Example:**

```javascript
getMostCommonGenres(books);
/*
  [
    { name: "Nonfiction", count: 9 },
    { name: "Historical Fiction", count: 7 },
    { name: "Thriller", count: 7 },
    ...
  ]
*/
```

### getMostPopularBooks()

The `getMostPopularBooks()` function in `public/src/home.js` has a single parameter:

- An array of book objects.

It returns an array containing five objects or fewer that represents the most popular books in the library. Popularity is represented by the number of times a book has been borrowed.

Each object in the returned array has two keys:

- The `name` key which represents the title of the book.
- The `count` key which represents the number of times the book has been borrowed.

Even if there is a tie, the array should only contain no more than five objects.

**Example:**

```javascript
getMostPopularBooks(books);
/*
  [
    { name: "incididunt nostrud minim", count: 30 },
    { name: "culpa do sint", count: 30 },
    { name: "ullamco est minim", count: 29 },
    ...
  ]
*/
```

### getMostPopularAuthors()

The `getMostPopularAuthors()` function in `public/src/home.js` has two parameters, in the following order:

- An array of book objects.
- An array of author objects.

It returns an array containing five objects or fewer that represents the most popular authors whose books have been checked out the most. Popularity is represented by finding all of the books written by the author and then adding up the number of times those books have been borrowed.

Each object in the returned array has two keys:

- The `name` key which represents the first and last name of the author.
- The `count` key which represents the number of times the author's books have been borrowed.

Even if there is a tie, the array should contain no more than five objects.

**Example:**

```javascript
getMostPopularAuthors(books, authors);
/*
  [
    { name: "Cristina Buchanan", count: 112 },
    { name: "Tami Hurst", count: 83 },
    { name: "Chrystal Lester", count: 80 },
    ...
  ]
*/
```
### Create a helper function

A helper function is a function that executes part of the logic of another function. Helper functions make your programs easier to understand by letting you give descriptive names to computations and reuse them. For this exercise, create at least one helper method for any of the functions that you implemented for this assignment.
